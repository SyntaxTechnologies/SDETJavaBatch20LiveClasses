When should we use while loop?
    When we do not know the number of iterations in advance it's better
    to go with while loop.
    for example if you are searching for something on a webpage and
    you have a lot of results you might not know how many results
    you have to go through before you see your desired result.
When should we use Do while loop?
    When we want to execute the code inside the loop at least once
    before checking the condition we should use do while loop.
When should we use for loop?
    When we know the iterations in advance we can go and use a for loop.
