Nested If else:
    We use Nested if else when we have to check multiple conditions and
    the conditions are dependent on each other.
general GuideLines:
    1)Always place the starting and closing brackets together.
    2) Go through the code line by line step by step.
    3) Check which conditions are dependent on which other conditions
    4) Use the intellij to figure out the code which is affected
    by a condition.
Logical Operators:
Not(!) operator:
    It reverses the boolean conditions.
OR(||)
    It helps us combine multiple boolean condition in such a way that
    if one condition is true the overall result is true and if all conditions
    are false the result is false.
AND(&&):
    It helps us combine multiple boolean condition in such a way that
    if All conditions are true then only the overall result is true
    other its false.
