How OOPS is going to help us?
Class and objects

Method:
Methods are blocks of code which contain java
statements which are executed
when we call a method.
why should we use methods?
So that we can reuse the code in other classes
without copying and pasting the code.
Local Variables:
    Local variables are those variables which are declared
    inside a method, loop ,if condition switch etc.
Instance variables:
    Instance variables are those variables which are declared
    outside a method, loop ,if condition switch etc.
static variables:
    All those variables which have static keyword with them
    are called static variables.
Access modifiers:



























add video for String buffer
add some examples for String methods show how
to use these methods further in if else
loops etc.
show from exisiting classes when we should use
privATE and when we should use public like all
the methods should be public and feilds should be
private
