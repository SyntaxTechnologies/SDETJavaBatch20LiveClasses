Collections framework:
     A collection of classes and interfaces which help
     us store and manipulate large amounts of data.
Some of the classes and interfaces are:
  List:
    1)ArrayList
    2)LinkedList
  Set:
    1)HashSet
    2)LinkedHashSet
    3)TreeSet
  Map:
  HashMap
  LinkedHashMap
  TreeMap
Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper are equivalent classes for primitive datatypes.
List:
    1)You can store duplicates inside the list.
    2)Insertion order is maintained.
ArrayList:
    Is better when most of our operations are accessing the data.
LinkedList:
    is better when most of the time we will be changing the data.

 Set:
    They don't allow duplicate items.
HashSet:
    Good:
        It's Fast.
    Bad:
        it does not remember the insertion order.
LinKedHashSet:
    Good:
    It remembers the insertion order.
    Bad:
        Slower as compared to the HashSet.
TreeSet:
    Good:
        Keeps the data sorted. which makes searching something really fast.
    Bad:
    inserting new elements is very slow.
Map:
    They are used to store key value pairs.
HashMap:
      Good:
          It's Fast.
      Bad:
          it does not remember the insertion order.
LinkedHashMap:
    Good:
        It remembers the insertion order.
    Bad:
        Slower as compared to the HashSet.
TreeMap:
    Good:
        Keeps the data sorted. which makes searching something really fast.
    Bad:
    inserting new elements is very slow.
